# Coevolution of constrained characters

When there are two or more phenotypic characters, or ecological
characteristics of a population such as efficiency of resource uptake,
that are in fact a function of a smaller number of "underlying" characters,
the population is constrained to a subset of the space of characters.  See
figure \ref{fig:constrained-p}.

We consider the selection gradient describing motion in the constrained
space and an abstract selection gradient giving the direction of motion
that would obtain if all variation in the unconstrained space were available
(see appendix for details).

The constrained selection gradient is
at an acute angle to the abstract selection gradient.  That is, it must
always be located within the half-space of vectors less than $$90^\circ$$ from
the abstract gradient vector.

At any fixed point of adaptation, either the abstract gradient vanishes,
or all motion in the constraint space is $$90^\circ$$ or more from the
abstract gradient.

# Coevolution of interaction terms

Lotka-Volterra interaction terms, $$a_{ij}$$ for each pair of populations
$$i$$ and $$j$$, can be treated similarly to phenotypic characters as
above, but parametrized by the phenotypes of two populations at a time,
rather than one.

That is, each interaction term $$a_{ij}$$ is a function of the characters
of populations $$i$$ and $$j$$: $$a_{ij} = a(u_i,u_j)$$.  In this expression,
population $$i$$ is the **patient** -- the entity affected by the interaction
-- and population $$j$$ is the **agent** -- the entity who affects the other.

Adaptive change in population $$i$$ is predicted by gradient of selection
on $$a_{ij}$$ terms for which $$i$$ is the patient.  (See appendices for
detailed treatment of all this.)

The "direct effect" of selection on $$a_{ij}$$ is change due to selection
on population $$i$$.

There is also the "indirect effect": change in each interaction
$$a_{ij}$$ due to selection on the agent $$j$$.

Because of the nature of the Lotka-Volterra equations, the abstract
selection gradient $$S$$ is always positive
because the $$j$$th entry of the $$S$$ vector is the mean size
$$\hat{X}_j$$ of population $$j$$.

The direct effect vector $$D$$ must be within $$90^\circ$$ of that
positive vector $$S$$.  Therefore the entries of $$D$$ are on average
positive (though they need not all be positive).

The actual motion of each row $$(a_{i1},\ldots,a_{in})$$ of the
Lotka-Volterra matrix is given by the sum 
$$\mathbf{D}_i+\mathbf{I}_i$$.  Assuming $$\mathbf{D}_i$$ is
biased toward positive and $$\mathbf{I}_i$$ is unbiased, coevolution is biased
toward motion in the positive direction, i.e. toward increase of mutual
benefit and decrease of harmful interactions. This assumption may not
hold however, see below.

Figure: Evolution of $$(a_{ij},a_{ji})$$ pair on the familiar plane of
Lotka-Volterra interactions.  The four quadrants of the plane are labeled
competition, predation (twice), and mutualism.

Figure: The vector $$A_i = (a_{i1},\ldots,a_{in})$$ moves in an
$$n$$-dimensional space (in the illustration $$n=2$$).  It's constrained
in two ways when each
population's variation is parametrized by one-dimensional character $$u_i$$.

Figure: Gradient of selection on $$A_i$$ in one dimension is in direction
closest to abstract
gradient of selection $$S$$.

Figure: Each population $$j$$ changes due to selection on $$a_{j\cdot}$$
terms. It causes change in $$a_{ij}$$, which is the source of the
indirect effects on $$A_i$$.

Figure: The direction of the direct effect is always in the half-space
within $$90^\circ$$ of the abstract selection gradient $$S$$.  $$S$$ is
always positive, which implies that the direct effect vector $$D$$ is
largely positive.  The resultant direction of actual change in $$A_i$$
is the sum $$\mathbf{D}_i+\mathbf{I}_i$$.  The positive bias in $$\mathbf{D}_i$$ may produce a
positive bias in the motion of $$A_i$$.

# Claims and questions about evolution of interactions

The above argument establishes that if direct effects and indirect effects
were IID random variables, interaction terms would drift in the direction
of increase, tending to convert antagonistic interactions into mutualistic
ones.

They may not be independent, though.  Interaction terms are structured and
correlated, and this structure may block the emergence of mutualism.  I
propose a three-part analysis of evolutionary change in interactions:

* The "default", or *ceteris paribus*, outcome is positive drift, toward
the mutualistic quadrant.  When interactions do not move in that direction,
there are two categories of constraints interfering with positive drift:
* Populations may not be able to increase the value of all their
interactions due to
tradeoffs in the different interaction terms affecting the population
as patient.  That is, the shape of the "fitness set" of the interactions
affecting the population.
* Gains in the value of interactions may be lost due to 
negative indirect effects of agents' adaptation
on patients.  This can imply a zero-sum situation in which one population's
gain is another's loss, or a Hardin-like tragedy ("race to the bottom",
or social trap),
in which a population's direct gain is indirectly its own loss.

In an earlier paper [@WordenLevin2007],
we proposed that

> emphasizing the

I propose the above three-part
structure as an alternative framework for researching the evolution of
cooperation, focusing on **factors that interfere with the emergence of
cooperation** in addition to studying means for mitigating tragic
situations in which cooperation is hard.

This research may help us to explain both mutualistic and
antagonistic situations in nature and society, and may also help
illuminate opportunities to transform antagonistic situations or
social traps to opportunities for mutual benefit. 

# Example: Resource competition

Here we analyze the classic MacArthur-Levins formulation of $$n$$
species competing for use of $$n$$ resources [insert citation].
To construct this model,
we begin by proposing a simple model for dynamics of $$n$$ species and $$n$$
resources:

$$\frac{dX_i}{dt} = b_iX_i(\sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell R_\ell - m_i)$$

$$\frac{dR_\ell}{dt} = r_\ell(K_\ell - R_\ell) - \sum_ic_{i\ell}X_i$$,

where $$X_i$$ is the density of population $$i$$, $$R_\ell$$ is the abundance of resource $$\ell$$ and the parameters are $$b_i$$, an intrinsic population growth rate, $$m_i$$, mortality rate, $$c_{i\ell}$$, the rate at which population $$i$$ captures resource $$\ell$$, $$w_\ell$$, the amount a unit of resource $$\ell$$ contributes to population growth, $$r_\ell$$, the resupply rate of resource $$\ell$$, and $$K_\ell$$ its maximum possible abundance.

We then reduce that model to a Lotka-Volterra form by making the
simplifying assumption that the resources come to equilibrium very quickly compared to the populations.  Under this assumption, we can hold the population sizes $$X_i$$ fixed and solve the second equation above for $$R_\ell$$ when $$\frac{dR_\ell}{dt}=0$$:

$${R}^*_\ell = K_\ell - \frac1{r_\ell}\sum_ic_{i\ell}X_i$$.

Then we simply use that value of $$R_\ell$$ in the first equation, and we have a system of population sizes only:

$$\frac{dX_i}{dt} = b_iX_i(\sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell(K_\ell - \frac1{r_\ell}\sum_jc_{j\ell}X_j) - m_i)$$.

We can rearrange the terms of this to have the standard Lotka-Volterra form:

$$\frac{dX_i}{dt} = k_iX_i + \sum_j a_{ij}X_i X_j$$,

where

$$k_i = b_i (\sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell K_\ell - m_i)$$

(ordinarily I'd call this $$r_i$$, but the name is already in use), and

$$a_{ij} = - b_i \sum_\ell \frac{c_{i\ell}c_{j\ell}w_\ell}{r_\ell}$$.

In this model, ecological competition is inevitable by assumption,
because the above forms are constructed so that $$a_{ij}$$ and $$a_{ji}$$
are always negative.  This constraint has implications in both the
direct and indirect effects emergent in the model.

## Evolution of ecological parameters

The parameters that can vary as population $$i$$ adapts are those that
are indexed by $$i$$: $$b_i$$, $$m_i$$, and $$c_{i\ell}$$ for each $$\ell$$. 
Let us give those functional forms, $$b_i=b(\mathbf{u}_i)$$,
$$m_i=m(\mathbf{u}_i)$$, and
$$c_{i\ell}=c_\ell(\mathbf{u}_i)$$, assuming some underlying phenotype
$$\mathbf{u}_i$$, and collect them into an "ecological phenotype" vector,

$$\mathbf p(\mathbf u_i)=\begin{pmatrix}b_i(\mathbf u_i)\\m_i(\mathbf u_i)\\c_{i1}(\mathbf u_i)\\\vdots\\c_{im}(\mathbf u_i)\end{pmatrix}$$.

This allows us to apply the analysis developed in the appendices.
The selection gradient on $$\mathbf p_i$$ is

<latex>$
 \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p_i) = \begin{pmatrix} 
  0 \\
  -b_i \\
  b_i \hat R_0 \\
  \vdots \\
  b_i \hat R_n \end{pmatrix},
$</latex>

indicating that selection on these populations tends to reduce mortality
and increase the conversion rate of each resource to births in proportion
to the abundance of that resources.  Interestingly, selection on the
overall birth rate $$b_i$$ is neutral, because variation in $$b_i$$ alone
does not give a variant an advantage over its resident parent type.
(It is possible to imagine that the overall birth rate may be
indirectly selected in some circumstances, however,
since it increases the rate of adaptation in other characters, potentially
allowing populations with higher birth rate to evade extinction better than
others.)

That vector is therefore the predicted mean direction of adaptation of
population $$i$$, if variation is available in all those quantities
equally: mortality $$m_i$$ will decline and resource uptake rates
$$c_{i\ell}$$ will increase in proportion to each resource's availability,
while overall birth rate $$b_i$$ remains constant or drifts neutrally.

The equilibrium resource availabilities $$\hat R_\ell$$ decline
as the populations'
uptake rates increase; this is not immediately obvious from the expression
$$\hat R_\ell = K_\ell - \frac1{r_\ell} \sum_i c_{i\ell}\hat X_i$$
because equilibrium population sizes $$\hat X_i$$ need to be found
by a matrix inversion, whose result is not intuitively obvious.  However,
it is a well known result of resource competition theory [@Tilman1982]
that the result of successive replacements in this community has the
effect of reducing the availability of all the affected resources.

As a special case, let us consider variation restricted to the uptake
rates $$c_{i\ell}$$,
since those are the quantities most relevant to our concerns about
competition.

In a community of one population consuming one resource,
the uptake rate increases, resource availability decreases, and as can
be seen from their forms, the intrinsic growth rate $$k_1$$, which is
positive, increases, and the Lotka-Volterra interaction term $$a_{11}$$,
which is negative, becomes larger in absolute value, signifying an increase
in competition (figure \ref{fig:maclev-1-1}).

In a community of two populations and two resources, when $$b_i$$ and
$$m_i$$ are fixed but the four $$c_{i\ell}$$ values are subject to
evolutionary change, the selection gradient on
$$\mathbf{p}_i=\left(\begin{smallmatrix} c_{i1} \\ c_{i2} \end{smallmatrix}\right)$$
is
$$b_i\left(\begin{smallmatrix} \hat R_1 \\ \hat R_2 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$$.

When $$c$$ values vary independently, they move according to the selection
gradient, increasing and drawing $$\hat R_1$$ and $$\hat R_2$$ down: see
figure \ref{fig:maclev-2-2}.

When the pair
$$\left(\begin{smallmatrix} c_{i1} \\ c_{i2} \end{smallmatrix}\right)$$
is constrained by dependence on a single real value $$u_i$$,
the direction of motion is described by the constrained selection gradient
on $$\mathbf p$$, as discussed in the appendix.  The selection gradient
on $$u$$ is

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{S}(u_i) &= \frac{\partial\mathbf p_i}{\partial u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p_i) \\
  &= b_i \sum_\ell \hat R_\ell \frac{dc_{i\ell}}{du_i},
\end{align*}</latex>

and $$u_i$$ will either increase or decrease, according as $$\mathbf{S}(u_i)$$ is
positive or negative.  By choosing a functional form $$c_\ell(u_i)$$ that
is either convex or concave, we can construct communities that select for
a single population generalized to consume both resources, or for a pair
of specialized populations.  [To do: details of these models. I could also
discuss geometrical connections between the selection gradient and ZNGI
analysis of species replacement on the $$R_1-R_2$$ plane. For this draft
I want to move on to the question about $$a_{ij}$$.]

## Evolution of Lotka-Volterra interactions

\end{figure}
</latex>

In the above models we have seen that contrary to this paper's
analysis, the Lotka-Volterra competition terms $$a_{ij}$$ do not decrease
in strength, let alone increase from negative to positive values.  We have
explained their negative trajectory in terms of the selection on the
ecological parameter $$c_{i\ell}$$.  Now let us analyze the evolution of
the Lotka-Volterra terms in terms of selection on those terms
and constraints among them.

The key step here is to understand the direction of selection
on each of the the Lotka-Volterra terms and how those effects produce
the resulting selection on the $$c_{i\ell}$$ values.

The Lotka-Volterra form of the MacArthur-Levins model breaks the
dynamics of the model into three parts, all relevant to understanding
when and why competition increases, as it does in the cases presented
above.

First and second are the two terms of the intrinsic growth term,

$$k_i = b_i\sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell K_\ell - b_im_i$$,

and third is the competition term

$$a_{ij} = -b_i\sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell \frac{c_{j\ell}}{r_\ell}$$.

This division of terms breaks the resource abundances

$$R^*_\ell = K_\ell - \sum_j \frac{c_{j\ell}}{r_\ell}X_j$$

into parts and invites us to consider them separately.  $$K_\ell$$ is
the abiotic abundance of $$R_\ell$$, the amount that would be present
if all consumer populations were absent.  Each coefficient
$$\frac{c_{i\ell}}{r_\ell}$$ is the rate of draw-down of resource $$\ell$$
per unit of consumer population $$i$$, and the weighted sum of abiotic
abundance and draw-down is the true abundance of $$R_\ell$$.

The intrinsic growth rate $$k_i$$, then, is the growth rate that
population $$i$$ would obtain if all resources were fixed at their
abiotic abundances.  Density dependence and competition are caused by
draw-down of the resources, and the Lotka-Volterra competition term
$$a_{ij}$$ directly reflects the effect of all the draw-down caused
by population $$j$$ on the growth rate of population $$i$$.

The interaction selection gradient, $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, is always the
same independent of the form of the Lotka-Volterra model:

$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \hat{X}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \hat{X}_n \end{pmatrix}$$,

indicating that selection on these populations favors increase in the
intrinsic growth rate $$k_1$$ at constant rate 1, and increase in the
interaction terms $$a_{ij}$$ at rate proportional to the long-term
average population sizes $$\hat{X}_j$$.

Since $$k_i$$ increases with $$c_{i\ell}$$ and decreases with $$m_i$$,
selection for increase in $$k_i$$ is selection for increase in $$c_{i\ell}$$
and decrease in $$m_i$$.  More precisely, the direction of selection on
$$b_i$$, $$m_i$$, and $$c_{i\ell}$$ due to selection on $$k_i$$ are given by

$$\frac{\partial k_i}{\partial b_i} = \sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell K_\ell - m_i$$

$$\frac{\partial k_i}{\partial m_i} = -b_i$$

$$\frac{\partial k_i}{\partial c_{i\ell}} = b_i w_\ell K_\ell$$.

The direction of selection in $$c_{i\ell}$$ is positive, and on $$m_i$$
is negative.  The direction of selection on $$b_i$$ has the same sign
as the population growth rate given abiotic resource abundances, which in
any useful community model must be positive.

The competition term $$a_{ij}$$, on the other hand, decreases with both
$$b_i$$ and the $$c_{i\ell}$$ terms, and is independent of $$m_i$$:

$$\frac{\partial a_{ij}}{\partial b_i} = - \sum_\ell c_{i\ell} w_\ell \sum_j \frac{c_{j\ell}}{r_\ell}$$

$$\frac{\partial a_{ij}}{\partial m_i} = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial a_{ij}}{\partial c_{i\ell}} = - b_i w_\ell \frac{c_{j\ell}}{r_\ell}$$.<latex>\footnote{Note that this partial derivative is taken only with respect
to the $c_{i\ell}$ term corresponding to the \emph{patient of the
interaction}, that is, the first argument of each interaction term
$a(u_i,u_j)$ -- see the appendix for
details.}</latex>

Therefore selection on $$a_{ij}$$ tends to decrease the overall growth
rate $$b_i$$ and the uptake rates $$c_{i\ell}$$.

The combination of these values adds up to the actual selection gradient
on the ecologial phenotype variables, which we already know
from the previous section:

<latex>\[
\mathbf{S}(\mathbf b_i) = \begin{pmatrix}
  \sum_\ell c_{i\ell} w_\ell (K_\ell - \sum_j \hat X_j \frac{c_\ell}{r_\ell}) - m_i \\
  -b_i \\
  b_i w_1 (K_1 - \sum_j\hat X_j\frac{c_{j1}}{r_1}) \\
  \vdots \\
  b_i w_n (K_n - \sum_j\hat X_j\frac{c_{jn}}{r_n}) \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 \\ -b_i \\
  \hat R_1 \\ \vdots \\ \hat R_n
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</latex>
(This is the sum $$\partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$ discussed in
the appendix.)

### Selection on $$k$$ causes competition to increase

However, considering them separately reveals additional information
about the causes of selection: specifically, that there is a tension
between selection on the $$k$$ term and selection on the $$a$$ terms
with regard to the direction of change in the $$c$$ values.  Selection
on the $$k$$ terms favors increase in $$c$$ values, because increasing
them increases the population's benefit from all the resources.  Selection
on $$c$$ terms via the $$a$$ terms, though, isolates the effect on
the patient population $$i$$ of resource draw-down due to each agent
population $$j$$, which is harmful to the patient.  Thus the two effects
on each $$c_{i\ell}$$ are at odds.

However, the amount of resource drawn down by the populations is never
as much as the amount available in the absence of draw-down.  Thus the
net effect of these different factors is always positive, and thus
the net selection on each $$c_{i\ell}$$ is in the direction of increase,
with the consequence that selection on the $$c_{i\ell}$$ terms will
always increase $$k_i$$ and decrease the $$a_{ij}$$ coefficients.

This is a **direct effect** on the $$a_{ij}$$ terms, in which
the dependence of both $$k_i$$ and $$a_{ij}$$ on $$c_{i\ell}$$ produces
a tradeoff such that an increase in one is a decrease in the other.

There is also an **indirect effect**, in which adaptation of each
population $$j$$ in the agent role has a side effect of decreasing
the benefit to $$i$$ of their interaction, i.e. of decreasing the value
of $$a_{ij}$$.  This is the effect that increasing each $$c_{j\ell}$$ has
on the value of $$a_{ij}$$: competition between populations intensifies
as resources become less abundant.
This includes the case $$j=i$$, in which population $$i$$ acts on
itself by drawing down the resources it needs to consume.

### Selection on $$a$$ terms alone decreases competition

The observation that increasing competition (negative change in $$a$$
terms) is caused by selection on $$k$$ terms, not on $$a$$ terms,
suggests an experiment: what would happen to $$a$$ terms if $$k$$ terms
were held fixed?

We can do this by imposing a trade-off between the $$c_{i\ell}$$ values,
which are involved in both $$a$$ and $$k$$ terms, and the mortality
$$m_i$$, which is involved only in $$k_i$$, constructed such that
$$k_i = b_i\sum_\ell c_{i\ell}w_\ell K_\ell - b_i m_i$$ is constant.
This is readily done by setting
$$m_i = m_0 + \sum_\ell c_{i\ell} w_\ell K_\ell$$
for some constant $$m_0<0$$.

This gives $$k_i = - b_i m_0$$, while all $$a_{ij}$$ terms are still
as above, and the net direction of selection on each $$c_{i\ell}$$
is now negative.  As a result, the $$c$$ values decrease, and the
competition terms $$a_{ij}$$ shrink by increasing toward zero,
indicating a decrease in competition.

[To do: analysis of this case by defining an "underlying phenotype"
$\mathbf u_i$, equal to the vector of $c_{i\ell}$ values, with the ecological
vector $\mathbf p_i$ as a function of those. The dependence of both
$m_i$ and $c_{i\ell}$ on $\mathbf u_i$ imposes a constraint that
translates selection on $a_{ij}$ terms into negative selection on
the terms of $\mathbf u_i$.]

[To do: move much of this example's analysis to appendix, leave only
discussion of it here.]

# Example: Predator-prey model

[In this model, interaction pairs are confined to the predation quadrants
by a negative correlation between $$a_{ij}$$ and $$a_{ji}$$.

This should be a matter of indirect effects.  Presumably if left to
indirect effects, predators would get fuller and fuller while eating fewer
and fewer prey.  When this doesn't happen, it's due to some kind of arms
race which takes the form of a tug-of-war in the indirect effects.  
Fuller analysis to come.]

Along with competition in conditions of scarcity, the most common scenario
for non-mutualistic interactions is predation.  To investigate the
constraints maintaining predation interactions, let us consider a simple
community model structured by predator-prey relationships.

In this model, a community is defined by a directed graph of predation
relationships, with an arrow connecting each prey population to each
of its predators.  Each population has a vector $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ of
underlying phenotype values, and the Lotka-Volterra interaction term for
each pair of populations is

<latex>$a_{ij} = a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) = \begin{cases} 
 - f(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) & \text{if }i\to j \\
 k f(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) & \text{if }j\to i \\
 -1 & \text{if both }i\leftrightarrow j \\
 0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}$</latex>

where we write $$i\to j$$ to mean that $$j$$ eats $$i$$, and
$$i\leftrightarrow j$$ to mean that both $$i$$ and $$j$$ are autotrophs,
meaning populations that have no prey.
$$k$$, between 0 and 1, is a rate of conversion efficiency from
prey killed to increase in predator population.
To provide some flow into the system and keep populations bounded, we
set

<latex>$r_i = r(\mathbf{u}_i) = \begin{cases}
 1 & \text{if }i \text{ is an autotroph} \\
 -1 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$</latex>

Thus the population dynamics equations are

$$\frac{dX_i}{dt} = X_i(r_i + \sum_{j\to i} k f(\mathbf{u}_j, \mathbf{u}_i) X_j - \sum_{i\to j} f(\mathbf{u}_i, \mathbf{u}_j) X_j - \sum_{i\leftrightarrow j} X_j)$$

for each $$i$$.

Populations adapt by changing their phenotypes $$\mathbf{u}_i$$, while
their placement in the food web stays fixed.  By choosing a functional
form $$f(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)>0$$, we can investigate the interplay
between coevolution and strength of interactions, while interactions
are constrained to be either predator-prey interactions or the
density-dependent competition among autotrophs that keeps the populations'
sizes bounded.

For simplicity, let's say $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ (in this case, $$u_i$$) is
a single real number.

## Selection pressures on predators and prey

The selection gradients follow directly from the analysis of the appendices.
Because $$r$$ is constant for each population, selection is only through
the $$a$$ terms, and that only through the terms involving the predation
strength function $$f$$.  Given the long-term average population sizes
$$\hat{X}_i$$, the selection gradient on $$u_i$$ is

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{S}(u_i) &= \sum_j \partial_1 a(u_i,u_j) \hat{X}_j \\
  &= \sum_{j\to i} k\partial_2 f(u_j,u_i) \hat{X}_j - \sum_{i\to j} \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j) \hat{X}_j.
\end{align*}</latex>

Below I will use the functional form

$$f(u_i,u_j) = 2 + \alpha \cos( u_i - u_j ),$$

with some $$\alpha\in(0,1)$$.

When $$f(u_i,u_j)$$ depends only on the difference $$u_i-u_j$$, with an
antisymmetry relationship
$$f'(-x) = -f'(x)$$, then we have
$$\partial_2 f(u_j,u_i) = \frac{d}{du_i}f(u_j-u_i) = - f'(u_j-u_i) = f'(u_i-u_j) = \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j)$$,
which gives

<latex>\[ \mathbf{S}(u_i) = \sum_{j\to i} k \hat{X}_j f'(u_i-u_j) - \sum_{i\to j} \hat{X}_j f'(u_i-u_j). \]</latex>

Thus the direction of selection on $$u_i$$ depends on a weighted sum
of influences of its prey and/or predators, shaped by each other population's
size, the difference in their phenotype values $$u$$, and the form of the
function $$f$$.  In the trigonometric case it is

<latex>\[ \mathbf{S}(u_i) = \sum_{j\to i} k \hat{X}_j \sin(u_i-u_j) - \sum_{i\to j} \hat{X}_j \sin(u_i-u_j). \]</latex>

With this trigonometric functional form, predation is most intense when
predator's and prey's
$$u$$ values match (give or take a multiple of $$2\pi$$), and least intense
when they differ by an odd multiple of $$\pi$$.

<!--- Modulo multiples
of $$\pi$$, when $$u$$ values are close, predators will tend to approach
their prey's $$u$$ values, and prey will tend to move away from their
predator's.  The relative rates of approach and retreat depend on the
conversion rate $$k$$ and on the population sizes $$\hat{X}$$.

### Example: one prey, one predator

When there is only population 1 eating population 0, the Lotka-Volterra
system is

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{dX_0}{dt} &= X_0 ( 1 - X_0 - X_1 (1 + \cos( u_0 - u_1 )) ) \\
\frac{dX_1}{dt} &= X_1 ( -1 + k X_0 (1 + \cos( u_0 - u_1 )) )
\end{align*}</latex>

These populations' adaptive dynamics follow their selection gradients:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{S}(u_0) &= - \hat{X}_1 \sin( u_0 - u_1 ) \\
\mathbf{S}(u_1) &= k \hat{X}_0 \sin( u_0 - u_1 ).
\end{align*}</latex>

Each population's full adaptive dynamics is proportional to its own size
as well:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{du_0}{dt} &= - \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \sin( u_0 - u_1 ) \\
\frac{du_1}{dt} &= k \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \sin( u_0 - u_1 ).
\end{align*}</latex>

From this we can readily see, since $$0<k<1$$, that

$$\frac{d(u_0-u_1)}{dt} = \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 (k - 1) \sin( u_0 - u_1 )$$

is opposite in sign to $$\sin(u_0-u_1)$$, so that it is positive when
$$u_0 - u_1$$ is small and positive, and negative when $$u_0-u_1$$ is
small and negative.  Thus
$$u_0$$ can escape from $$u_1$$ when the two are close.

This example perhaps follows the "life-dinner hypothesis", in which
selection acts more strongly on prey because they have more to lose
from each interaction [@DawkinsKrebs1979].

Equilibria of this system are configurations where one or more populations
go extinct ($$\hat{X}_i = 0$$) or where $$u_0-u_1$$ is a multiple of $$\pi$$.
As we have seen, $$u_0-u_1=0$$ is unstable. By the analogous argument,
$$u_0-u_1=(2n+1)\pi$$ is stable, which is the configuration that minimizes
the strength of predation $$f$$, and maximizes the negative interaction
term $$a_{01}$$.

#### Extinctions in this example

[To do: analyze extinctions, then use what I learned to create a simpler
model where I don't have to deal with them.]

The coexistence equilibrium of the population dynamics satisfies

<latex>\begin{align*}
\hat{X}_0 &= \frac{1}{kf(u_0-u_1)} \\
\hat{X}_1 &= \frac{1-\hat{X}_0}{f(u_0-u_1)} = \frac{kf(u_0-u_1)-1}{kf(u_0-u_1)^2}
\end{align*}</latex>

So coexistence requires $$kf(u_0-u_1) > 1$$.

### Direct and indirect effects in the 2-species example

The direct and indirect effects predicting the evolution of interactions
can be written directly using the definitions in the appendix.
The terms of the interaction phenotype
vector for population $$i$$ are the terms involved in the population dynamics
equation for $$X_i$$:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{A}_0 &= \begin{pmatrix} r_0 \\ a_{00}\\ a_{01} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ -f(u_0-u_1) \end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbf{A}_1 &= \begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\ a_{10}\\ a_{11} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ kf(u_0-u_1) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}</latex>

The direct effect, $$\mathbf{D}_i = \gamma \hat{X}_i \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, is

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{D}_0 &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ - f'(u_0-u_1) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -f'(u_0-u_1) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \hat{X}_0 \\ \hat{X}_1 \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ f'(u_0-u_1)^2 \end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbf{D}_1 &= \gamma \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ k f'(u_0-u_1) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & kf'(u_0-u_1) & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \hat{X}_0 \\ \hat{X}_1 \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ k^2 f'(u_0-u_1)^2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}</latex>

Due to the sparsity of terms depending on phenotypes in the $$\mathbf{A}$$
vectors, we find direct effects only affecting the predation terms,
$$a_{01}$$ and $$a_{10}$$.  The prey species 0 adapts in a way that directly
reduces the predation on it, and the predator, species 0, adapts so as to
increase the predation feeding it.

The indirect effects are also concentrated on those two terms:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{I}_0 &= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \hat{X}_0 \partial_2a(u_0,u_0) \mathbf{S}(u_0) \\ \hat{X}_1 \partial_2a(u_0,u_1) \mathbf{S}(u_1) \end{pmatrix}
  = \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ - \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 f'(u_0-u_1) \mathbf{S}(u_1) \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ - k f'(u_0-u_1)^2 \end{pmatrix} \\
\mathbf{I}_1 &= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \hat{X}_0 \partial_2a(u_1,u_0) \mathbf{S}(u_0) \\ \hat{X}_1 \partial_2a(u_1,u_1) \mathbf{S}(u_1) \end{pmatrix}
  = \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 k f'(u_0-u_1) \mathbf{S}(u_0) \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ - k f'(u_0-u_1)^2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}</latex>

The indirect effects are the effects of each species's evolution on
the other: change in the predator species increases predation on the
prey, and change in the prey decreases the benefit to the predator.

Putting these together gives the resulting change in interactions:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{d\mathbf{A}_0}{dt} &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ (1-k)f'(u_0-u_1)^2 \end{pmatrix} \\
\frac{d\mathbf{A}_1}{dt} &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ (k^2-k)f'(u_0-u_1)^2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}</latex>

The form of the predator-prey interaction terms imposes the constraint
$$a_{10} = -ka_{01}$$, so that their derivatives must also have a $$-1:k$$
ratio, and the above expression confirms that.

The representation in terms of Lotka-Volterra pairs is especially relevant
here, since there is only one pair of interest:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{da_{(0,1)}}{dt} &= \frac{d}{dt}\begin{pmatrix} a_{01} \\ a_{10} \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= D_{(0,1)} + I_{(0,1)} \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \left[ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ k^2 \end{pmatrix}
      + \begin{pmatrix} -k \\ -k \end{pmatrix} \right] f(u_0-u_1)^2 \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_0 \hat{X}_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -k \end{pmatrix} (1-k) f(u_0-u_1)^2 \\
\end{align*}</latex>

## Direct and indirect effects in the general case

In an unspecified foodweb, with an unspecified functional form $$f(u_i,u_j)$$,
we have as above

$$\mathbf{S}(u_i) = \sum_{j\to i} k \partial_2f(u_j,u_i) \hat{X}_j - \sum_{i\to j} \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j) \hat{X}_j,$$

which describes a population $$u_i$$ adapting by moving towards its prey
and away from its predators, each weighted by its long-term population size,
and with the selective pressure due to prey attentuated by a factor of
$$k<1$$.

Lotka-Volterra interactions fall naturally into predator-prey pairs
$$a_{(i,j)}$$, and the motion of each pair (where we assume without
loss of generality that $$i$$ is the prey of $$j$$) is

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{da_{(i,j)}}{dt} &= D_{(i,j)} + I_{(i,j)} \\
  &= \gamma \left[ \begin{pmatrix}
       - \hat{X}_i \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j) \mathbf{S}(u_i) \\
       \hat{X}_j k \partial_2 f(u_i,u_j) \mathbf{S}(u_j)
     \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}
       - \hat{X}_j \partial_2 f(u_i,u_j) \mathbf{S}(u_j) \\
       \hat{X}_i k \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j) \mathbf{S}(u_i)
     \end{pmatrix} \right] \\
  &= \gamma \left[ \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k
     \end{pmatrix}  \hat{X}_i \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j) \mathbf{S}(u_i)
     + \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k
     \end{pmatrix} \hat{X}_j \partial_2 f(u_i,u_j) \mathbf{S}(u_j)
    \right] \\
  &= \gamma \left[ \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k
     \end{pmatrix}  \hat{X}_i \partial_1 f(u_i,u_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i
     + \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ k
     \end{pmatrix} \hat{X}_j \partial_2 f(u_i,u_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j
    \right] \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}),
\end{align*}</latex>

# Example: Emergence and loss of mutualism

In the natural history of fig-fig wasp mutualisms, the coevolving tree and
insect species have transitioned from parasitism to mutualism, and from
mutualism to parasitism, a number of times.  A trade-off model captures this,
and I reexamine it in terms of direct and indirect effects and the abstract
selection gradient.

[To come]

# Example: statistical mechanics of interactions.

Create a model of a large number of coexisting species with an interaction
function ($$a(u_i,u_j)$$) just complex enough to allow pairs of species to
move among all four quadrants independently.  Hypothesis: coevolution
produces a statistical drift toward the upper right.

# Example: Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons

This model turns out to be formally equivalent to the resource competition
model with only one species (here called "cattle ranchers").

We understand the tragedy of the commons as an indirect effect of the
population on itself: as patient, the adaptive step (deploy more livestock)
improves utility, but as agent, that step leads to a degradation in the
environment and drags the population's utility down.

It's probably interesting to tease out the direct effects in this
model, since we understand the tragedy of the commons as an indirect effect.

But we also need to unpack the difference between using a utility function
to define benefit (vs. harm) and using Lotka-Volterra terms to define it.
The tragedy of the commons is a question of declining utility, and that may
be different from the benefit that's defined by motion up and to the right
in the Lotka-Volterra plane: specifically, utility is an absolute quantity
while L-V values are marginal.  There is no absolute fitness in the
coevolutionary analysis I'm using, only differences in fitness relative to
a baseline which is always redefined to be zero.  (However, the entries
of a game theory payoff matrix are closely analogous to L-V interaction
terms, and in fact they are indistinguishable from them when the replicator
dynamics model is used.)

This and the game theory section below might be better to leave for
a future paper

# Example: adaptive change in a game theory payoff matrix

Adaptation of economic actors by learning, under just about any reasonable
simple model assumptions (within the rational-choice framework), follows the
same gradient as the above evolutionary models.  Thus all the geometrical 
analysis holds, including the three-part research framework.

In this section I demonstrate how the terms of the game's payoff matrix
change in just the same way as the Lotka-Volterra interaction terms.

Then make a little sketch of how a social interaction might transition among
prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift, stag hunt, and byproduct cooperation
structures, seen as a matter of coevolving constrained terms of the
payoff matrix.

# Discussion

# Appendices

## Adaptive change in constrained characters

Let $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ be a vector of numbers representing phenotypic
characters undergoing adaptive change in the $$i$$th population under
consideration.  Under adaptive dynamics assumptions [@Metzet1996],
the dynamics of the population's change in evolutionary time is [@Maet2007]

$$\frac{d\mathbf p_i}{dt} = \left. \gamma \hat{X}_i \frac{\partial\mathcal I(\mathbf q|\mathbf p_1,\ldots,\mathbf p_n)}{\partial \mathbf q}\right|_{\mathbf q=\mathbf p_i} = \gamma \hat{X}_i \partial_1\mathcal I(\mathbf p_i)^T$$,

where $$\mathcal I(q|E)$$ is the **invasion fitness** function: the long-term
growth rate of a very small population of type $$q$$ in environment $$E$$.
In the above formulation we assume that the community defined by all
coexisting populations' monomorphic phenotypes $$\mathbf{p}_j$$ is
sufficient to define the selective environment $$E$$.

In the above notation, $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ is a column vector,
$$\frac{\partial\mathcal I}{\partial\mathbf p_i}$$ is a row vector,
$$\hat{X}_i$$ is the long-term average size of population $$i$$,
the superscript $$T$$ stands for the vector transpose,
and $$\partial_1$$ stands for the partial derivative with respect to
the function's first argument.  The variable $$\gamma$$ is a constant
encapsulating the overall rate of evolutionary change.

Both $$\gamma$$ and $$\hat{X}_i$$ in the above expression are positive
scalar quantities, so the direction of adaptive change in $$\mathbf{p}_i$$
is in the direction of greatest increase in the invasion fitness available
to a rare variant $$\mathbf v$$.  Let us refer to that direction as the
**gradient of selection**, or **selection gradient**, of $$\mathbf{p}_i$$:

$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i) = \partial_1\mathcal I(\mathbf p_i)^T$$,

[To do: the important thing here is that it's the partial derivative with respect
to the rare type, as opposed to the partial derivative with respect to the
second $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ argument (in which it is the resident type), or
the total derivative with respect to $$\mathbf{p}_i$$.  We are really
interested in patterns of change in the components of $$\mathcal{I}$$
determined by the total derivative, when change is driven only by the
first partial derivative.
This pattern of change in the value, fitness, or utility driven by its first
partial derivative is in some sense the signature of adaptive change,
whether in adaptive dynamics models, population genetics,
economics, or animal behavior (and organizational change? acquisition of
immunity?  look into it).  Make this generality explicit, to clarify that
this paper's conclusions apply to all these things.

The corresponding thing in population genetics is presumably the change in
allele frequencies, $$\frac{dp_i}{dt}$$, in the direction of
$$\frac{\partial w}{\partial p_i}$$, when fitness $$w$$ is frequency-dependent,
and has just the same considerations about the arguments $$p_i$$
representing patients and agents (analogous to rare types and residents --
terminology defined below), and taking the partial derivative with
respect to the patients, while impacts of agents on various patients
are left as externalities not considered by selection.]

When a population's phenotype is confined to only a bounded set within the
full space of possible values, the above dynamics is only applicable at
points where all degrees of freedom are available.  Often the population
will evolve to the boundary of that set, in which case its motion comes
to be confined to that boundary.  This become the dynamics of a vector
constrained to a lower-dimensional subset of the space of possible values.
That constraint can be represented by considering the phenotype to be
a function of a smaller number of variables.  We represent that by introducing
an "underlying" phenotype vector $$\mathbf{u}_i$$, with a smaller number
of entries, and writing the phenotype $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ as a function
$$\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{u}_i)$$.

The dynamics of the underlying phenotype evolves in the standard way:

$$\frac{d\mathbf u_i}{dt} = \left. \gamma \hat{X}_i \frac{\partial\mathcal I(\mathbf v|\mathbf u_1,\ldots,\mathbf u_n)}{\partial \mathbf v}\right|_{\mathbf v=\mathbf u_i} = \gamma \hat{X}_i \partial_1\mathcal I(\mathbf u_i)^T$$,

and the constrained dynamics of the constrained phenotype $$\mathbf{p}_i$$
follows from the chain rule:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i) &= \partial_1\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{u}_i)^T \\
  &= \left(\partial_1\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{p}_i)\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}\right)^T \\
  &= \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \partial_1\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{p}_i)^T \\
  &= \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i) \\
\frac{d\mathbf p(\mathbf u_i)}{dt} &= \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}\frac{d\mathbf u_i}{dt} \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_i \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i) \\
  &= \gamma \hat{X}_i \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)
\end{align*}</latex>

While in the standard, unconstrained case, adaptive change in the phenotype
$$\mathbf{p}_i$$ follows the direction of the gradient of the invasion
fitness, $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)$$,

$$\frac{d\mathbf p_i}{dt} = \gamma \hat{X}_i \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p_i)$$,

in the constrained case, it is the underlying phenotype $$\mathbf{u}$$ that
follows its selection gradient:

$$\frac{d\mathbf u_i}{dt} = \gamma \hat{X}_i \mathbf{S}(\mathbf u_i)$$,

while the constrained phenotype is stopped from following its selection
gradient by its constraints, which limit it to change in a smaller space
of available directions.  Thus its derivative is in a different direction:

$$\frac{d\mathbf p(\mathbf u_i)}{dt} = \gamma \hat{X}_i S_c(\mathbf{p}_i)$$,

where
$$S_c(\mathbf{p}_i) = \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p)$$
is the **constrained selection gradient** of $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ determined
by the available variation in $$\mathbf{u}_i$$.

This derivative is a vector derived from the gradient of unconstrained
selection, $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)$$, by multiplying it by a matrix
$$\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u}^T$$.
That matrix contains information about the directions available to
change in $$\mathbf{p}$$ as $$\mathbf{u}$$ varies, and the product
$$\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p)$$
is a vector pointing in a direction of change in $$\mathbf{p}$$ that
can be obtained by varying the underlying vector $$\mathbf{u}$$.

The following lemma establishes an important relationship between the
direction of constrained change and the gradient of unconstrained selection:
the angle between the two vectors is always $$90^\circ$$ or less.

**Lemma.** The direction of motion of the above phenotype vector
$$\mathbf{p}_i$$ constrained by an underlying phenotype $$\mathbf{u}_i$$
is always at an angle no greater than $$90^\circ$$ to the unconstrained
selection gradient $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)$$.

*Proof: Consider the dot product of the two vectors:*

<latex>\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p_i)\right) \cdot \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)
  &= \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p_i)\right)^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i) \\
  &= \mathbf{S}(\mathbf p_i)^T\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i} \frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i) \\
  &= \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)\right)^T \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)\right) \\
  &= \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\partial\mathbf p}{\partial \mathbf u_i}^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)\right) \\
  &\geq 0,
\end{align*}</latex>

*because the dot product of a vector with itself is always nonnegative.
The dot product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes, a
positive quantity, multiplied by the cosine of the angle $$\theta$$
between them.  When the dot product is positive, it follows that
$$\cos(\theta)\geq0$$, which implies that $$\theta$$ is $$90^\circ$$
or less.* <latex>\qedsymbol</latex>

Here is another way of expressing the same conclusion:

**Corollary.** The selection gradient $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)$$ defines a
half-space bounded by the vectors perpendicular to $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)$$
and including $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{p}_i)$$,
and the direction of motion of a constrained vector $$\mathbf{p}_i$$
must always be within that half-space.

When $$\mathbf{p}_i$$ is constrained to a curve, this half-space generally
determines the direction of its motion, as only one direction on the curve
falls within that half-space.  

## Direct and indirect effect of adaptation on interaction terms

The Lotka-Volterra interaction term between populations $$i$$ and $$j$$, $$a_{ij}$$, is
similar to a phenotype constrained by a vector of underlying characters,
but is parametrized by two populations' characters rather than one:
$$a_{ij}=a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)$$.  As a result, the motion of
$$a_{ij}$$ as the community of populations adapts is similar but more
complex to analyze.

In a Lotka-Volterra model defined by the population dynamics equations

$$\frac{dX_i}{dt} = \left( r(\mathbf{u}_i) + \sum_j a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) X_j \right) X_i$$,

the invasion fitness is the function

$$ \mathcal I(\mathbf{v}|\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{u}_n) = r(\mathbf{v}) + \sum_j a(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}_j) \hat{X}_j,$$

and the gradient of selection on population $$i$$ is

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i)
  &= \partial_1\mathcal I(\mathbf{v}|\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{u}_n)^T \\
  &= \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathbf{v}}\left(r(\mathbf{v}) + \sum_j a(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}_j) \hat{X}_j\right)^T\right|_{\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{u}_i} \\
  &= r'(\mathbf{u}_i)^T + \sum_j \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)^T \hat{X}_j.
\end{align*}</latex>

[To do: flesh out the derivation of that invasion fitness, since it's
a key step.]

We already know the motion of the underlying phenotypes:

$$\frac{d\mathbf u_i}{dt} = \gamma \hat{X}_i \mathbf{S}(\mathbf u_i)$$,

and from that we can derive the motion of the Lotka-Volterra terms,
both the intrinsic growth $$r$$ and the interaction terms $$a_{ij}$$.

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{dr_i}{dt} &= r'(\mathbf{u}_i)\frac{d\mathbf{u}_i}{dt} \\
  &= r'(\mathbf{u}_i) \gamma \hat{X}_i \mathbf{S}(\mathbf u_i) \\
\frac{da_{ij}}{dt}
  &= \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)\frac{d\mathbf{u}_i}{dt}
   + \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)\frac{d\mathbf{u}_j}{dt} \\
  &= \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \gamma \hat{X}_i \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i)
   + \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \gamma \hat{X}_j \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_j).
\end{align*}</latex>

We have seen, above, that the selection gradient on population $$i$$,
$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i)$$, is determined not by all the interaction terms involving
population $$i$$, but only by the terms in which $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ appears
*in the first of the two arguments*, together with the $$r$$ term
for population $$i$$'s intrinsic growth.

I will refer to these as the terms in which population $$i$$ is the **patient**
-- the entity acted on -- distinct from the **agent** -- the entity acting on
the other.  The adaptation of population $$i$$ is driven by selection on
the interactions that affect population $$i$$, not by the effects population
$$i$$ has on others (even on itself, as we will see).

We can draw a useful analogy with the analysis of constrained phenotypes, above,
by defining a sort of "interaction phenotype" of population $$i$$, consisting
of the quantities that drive selection on population $$i$$.  That is a vector

$$\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{pmatrix} r(\mathbf{v}) \\ a(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}_1) \\ \vdots \\ a(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}_n) \end{pmatrix}$$.

Let

$$\mathbf{A}_i = \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{u}_1)$$.

Then we can reformulate the motion of $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ in terms of this
vector. Since

$$\partial_1\mathbf{A}_i = \begin{pmatrix} r'(\mathbf{u}_i) \\ \partial_1a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_1) \\ \vdots \\ \partial_1a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_n) \end{pmatrix}$$

and

$$\frac{\partial\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{v}|\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{u}_n)}{\partial\mathbf{A}_i} = ( 1, \hat{X}_1, \ldots, \hat{X}_n )$$,

we can define an **interaction selection gradient**

$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i) = \left.\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{I}(\mathbf{v}|\mathbf{u}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{u}_n)}{\partial\mathbf{A}_i}\right)^T\right|_{\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{u}_i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \hat{X}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \hat{X}_n \end{pmatrix}$$

and rewrite the selection gradient of the underlying phenotype just as
we did in the constrained-$$\mathbf{p}$$ case:

$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i) = \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$.

However, we can not simply write the motion of $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ as
$$\frac{d\mathbf{A}_i}{dt} = \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T\frac{d\mathbf{u}_i}{dt}$$
by analogy to the $$\mathbf{p}$$ case, because the motion of the
$$a_{ij}$$ terms depends on their agent populations $$\mathbf{u}_j$$
as well as the patient $$\mathbf{u}_i$$.

The full equation of motion for $$\mathbf{A}_i$$, and thus for the
motion of all the $$r$$ and $$a$$ terms of the Lotka-Volterra model,
requires two terms, which I call a **direct effect**, $$\mathbf{D}_i$$, of
selection on population $$i$$, and an **indirect effect**, $$\mathbf{I}_i$$, of
selection on all the populations in the community on the $$i$$th interaction
phenotype:

<latex>\begin{align*}
\mathbf{D}_i &= \gamma \hat{X}_i \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i) = \gamma \hat{X}_i \begin{pmatrix} r'(\mathbf{u}_i) \\ \partial_1a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_1) \\ \vdots \\ \partial_1a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_n) \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i) \\
\mathbf{I}_i &= \gamma \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \hat{X}_1 \partial_2a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_1) \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_1) \\ \vdots  \\ \hat{X}_n \partial_2a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_n) \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_n) \end{pmatrix} \\
\frac{d\mathbf{A}_i}{dt}
  &= \mathbf{D}_i + \mathbf{I}_i.
\end{align*}</latex>

[TODO: $$\mathbf{S}$$ is a column vector, $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ is a column vector,
$$\partial_1\mathbf{A}_i$$ is either a column or a rectangular matrix, etc.]

indirect effects of selection on both populations 1 and 2, the vector
$\mathbf{A}_i$ does not generally remain confined to that curve as

The direct effect is analogous to the constrained selection gradient
of a constrained phenotype $$\mathbf{p}$$.  It must be within $$90^\circ$$
of the selection gradient $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, for the same reasons
as in the constrained phenotype case.

Here is a summary of the
different components of adaptive motion of Lotka-Volterra coefficients:

* Given $$n$$ populations, there are $$n$$ intrinsic growth terms $$r_i$$
and $$n^2$$ interaction terms $$a_{ij}$$.
* We arrange those values into $$n$$ "interaction phenotypes" $$\mathbf{A}_i$$.
* For each $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ there is a selection gradient
$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, which is the direction of greatest increase in
the invasion fitness of population $$i$$, when we vary population $$i$$
as a rare invading population with all resident populations' phenotypes
held fixed (including population $$i$$), that is, as the first argument
to $$k(\mathbf u_i)$$ and $$a(\mathbf u_i, \mathbf u_j)$$, the patient.
* Adaptive change in the $$i$$th population must be in a direction that
would move $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ within $$90^\circ$$ of its selection gradient
$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, considering $$i$$ as an invader with all resident 
populations held fixed.
* The direction of change in $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ due to that change in the
$$i$$th population is the "direct effect" of selection on $$\mathbf{A}_i$$,
$$\mathbf{D}_i$$.
* The direction of change in $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ due to changes in all the
resident populations, considered as agents, i.e. as the second argument to
$$a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)$$, is the "indirect effect" of selection
on $$\mathbf{A}_i$$,
$$\mathbf{I}_i$$.  Note that this includes an indirect effect of population
$$i$$ on itself.

## Upward bias in direct effects

In general, there is nothing apparent that we can assume about the form
of the functions $$r$$ and $$a$$ and their derivatives.  $$\partial_1 a$$
and $$\partial_2 a$$ may be positive, negative, or zero at any time
during the evolution of a community.

However, the above results imply a bias toward a positive sign in the
derivatives of $$r$$ and $$a$$ terms.

The selection gradient $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, which defines the
directions of motion available to $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ resulting from selection on
$$\mathbf{u}_i$$, is a special vector that is the same for all $$i$$:

$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \hat{X}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \hat{X}_n \end{pmatrix},$$

where $$\hat{X}_j$$ is the long-term average population size of
population $$j$$.

It immediately follows that the entries of this vector are all nonnegative.
If we assume that extinct populations have been removed from the model, 
**the entries of the selection gradient $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$ are all positive**.

Since the direct effect vector $$\mathbf{D}_i$$, just like the constrained
selection vector $$S_c(\mathbf{p}_i)$$, must be within $$90^\circ$$ of 
the selection gradient, the direct effect is confined to directions that
are within $$90^\circ$$ of this positive vector.  While this does not
imply that all the entries of $$\mathbf{D}_i$$ are positive, it does
imply that at least some of them must be positive, and it suggests that
in some sense, "all else being equal," entries of this vector should
be more often positive than not.

We can draw no conclusions about the sign of $$\mathbf{I}_i$$ one way or
another.  If we were to assume naively that, sampling over many realistic
population biology models, the first and second partial derivatives of the
$$a$$ function would be distributed around a mean of zero, for lack of
a reason to imagine them biased one way or another, we would have to
conclude that $$\mathbf{I}_i$$ would be unbiased with mean zero and
$$\mathbf{D}_i$$ would be biased with positive mean entries, and
consequently that the motion of $$\mathbf{A}_i$$ and therefore the motion
of the Lotka-Volterra terms $$r_i$$ and $$a_{ij}$$ would tend to
increase.

Of course, in specific cases, those terms may not increase.  These results
suggest a framework for examining when they do and do not increase:

* The all-positive entries of the interaction selection gradient
can be interpreted in terms of the meaning of a specific model's parameters,
describing what selection "would like to do" if all degrees of freedom
were available.
* Constraints on actually available variation in $$r$$ and $$a$$ terms
cause the direct effect to point in a different direction from the
interaction selection gradient.  This can be interpreted in terms of
tradeoffs and constraints imposed by the functional form of $$r$$ and
$$a$$, as functions of the model's parameters.  Unpacking these constraints
can shed light on how model assumptions constrain the evolution of
interactions.
* The indirect effects of each population's adaptation on other populations,
and on itself, can change the resulting dynamics of interactions from
what they would be due to direct effects alone.  These effects can be
interpreted in terms of interplays or tensions between evolutionary
"self-interest" and impacts of ones change on others.

Understanding the three-part structure of the selection gradient, direct
effect, and indirect effect can also suggest ways to investigate how a model
would behave differently if certain assumptions were changed.

In the examples in this paper, I attempt to develop these themes
by exploring them in relation to familiar model scenarios of resource
competition, predation, evolution of mutualism, and the general development
of communities defined by Lotka-Volterra matrices.

## Direct and indirect effects in the Lotka-Volterra plane

Lotka-Volterra interactions are classified into competition, predation, and
mutualism by the location of the pair $$(a_{ij},a_{ji})$$ on the
two-dimensional plane.  Here we examine the action of selection on that
pair in that plane, which must not be confused with the motion of one
population's "interaction phenotype", $$\mathbf{A}_i$$, above.

Let $$a_{(i,j)}$$ stand for the pair $$\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a_{ij}\\a_{ji}\end{smallmatrix}\right)$$.

Let $$D_{ij} = \gamma \hat{X}_i \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_i)$$
and $$I_{ij} = \gamma \hat{X}_j \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{u}_j)$$
be the components of the direct and indirect effect vectors acting on
the term $$a_{ij}$$, so that

$$\frac{da_{ij}}{dt} = D_{ij} + I_{ij}$$.

Let
$$D_{(i,j)}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}D_{ij}\\D_{ji}\end{smallmatrix}\right)$$
and
$$I_{(i,j)}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}I_{ij}\\I_{ji}\end{smallmatrix}\right)$$.
Then, of course, [TODO: the dimensions of these matrices seem weirdly wrong]

<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}a_{(i,j)} &= D_{(i,j)} + I_{(i,j)} \\
  &= \gamma \begin{pmatrix}
      \hat{X}_i \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)
        + \hat{X}_j \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_j) \\
      \hat{X}_j \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_j)
        + \hat{X}_i \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)
     \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= \gamma \begin{pmatrix}
      \hat{X}_i \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T
        +  \hat{X}_j \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T \\
      \hat{X}_j \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T
        + \hat{X}_i \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \hat{X}_1 \\ \vdots \\ \hat{X}_n \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*}</latex>
where the last line makes use of the fact that the interaction selection
gradient, $$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)$$, is the same for all $$i$$.

There is no geometrical argument making this vector necessarily positive,
and in fact it can be negative.  Note, however, that the terms of all the
$$a_{(i,j)}$$ pairs taken together are the terms of the $$\mathbf{A}_i$$
vectors rearranged (without the $$r$$ terms), so any positive bias
occurring in those terms will also appear here.  Another way to look at
positive bias here is that the $$\partial_1 a$$ values appearing in the
above expressions are also entries in the $$\partial_1 \mathbf{A}$$ vectors
they are multiplying, so there will be some squared values there, skewing
the overall value toward the positive.

Alternatively, rather than separating direct from indirect effects, we
can look at the motion of $$a_{(i,j)}$$ due to change in $$i$$ and in $$j$$:
<latex>\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}a_{(i,j)} &= a_{(1)(i,j)} + a_{(2)(i,j)} \\
  &= \gamma \begin{pmatrix}
      \hat{X}_i \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i) \\
      \hat{X}_i \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)
    \end{pmatrix} + \gamma \begin{pmatrix}
        \hat{X}_j \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_j) \\
        \hat{X}_j \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i) \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_j)
     \end{pmatrix} \\
  &= \gamma \left[ \hat{X}_i \begin{pmatrix}
      \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \\ 
      \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i)
     \end{pmatrix} \partial_1\mathbf{A}_i^T
     + \hat{X}_j \begin{pmatrix}
      \partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j) \\
      \partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_j,\mathbf{u}_i)
     \end{pmatrix} \partial_1\mathbf{A}_j^T
    \right] \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}),
\end{align*}</latex>
where
$$\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A})=\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_i)=\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{A}_j)$$
is the positive interaction selection gradient.

Note to self: $$a(u_i,u_j)=\frac{u_i-2u_j}{10}+\sin(u_i-2u_j)$$ might work
as an $$a$$ function for this

Or to choose $$\theta, \rho$$ randomly and construct $$a$$ s.t. those are
the directions of $$\partial_1 a, \partial_2 a$$?  That is, with
$$\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^2$$,
$$\partial_1 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)=c\left(\cos\theta, \sin\theta\right)$$,
$$\partial_2 a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)=d\left(\cos\rho, \sin\rho\right)$$.

So maybe $$a(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{u}_j)=b + c\left(\cos\theta, \sin\theta\right) \mathbf{u}_i + d\left(\cos\rho, \sin\rho\right)\mathbf{u}_j$$?  Will need
to draw a separate $$(b,c,d,\theta,\rho)$$ for each $$i$$-$$j$$ pair,
with angles uniformly from $$[0,2\pi)$$, scalars maybe from $$N(0,1)$$?

I think I'll also need to do a community-assembly process to get a bunch
of them to coexist, then start the adaptive dynamics.

But no, not with $$\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^2$$, I think what I wanted was
for $$\theta$$ and $$\rho$$ to be the directions of $$a_{(i,j)}$$ as $$i$$
and $$j$$ shift. To do that I would want $$u\in\mathbb{R}$$ and 
$$(\partial_1a(u_i,u_j),\partial_2a(u_j,u_i))=c(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$$
and the other thing for $$\rho$$.

So with $$i$$ and $$j$$ sorted, for the $$(i,j)$$ pair choose
$$\theta,\rho$$, etc., and set
<latex>\begin{align*}
a(u_i,u_j) &= b_{ij} + c_{ij} \cos\theta_{ij} u_i + d_{ij} \cos\rho_{ij} u_j \\
a(u_j,u_i) &= b_{ji} + c_{ij} \sin\theta_{ij} u_i + d_{ij} \sin\rho_{ij} u_j.
\end{align*}</latex>
Then
<latex>\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix} \partial_1 a(u_i,u_j)\\\partial_2 a(u_j,u_i) \end{pmatrix}
  &= c_{ij} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta_{ij} \\ \sin\theta_{ij} \end{pmatrix} \\
\begin{pmatrix} \partial_2 a(u_i,u_j)\\\partial_1 a(u_j,u_i) \end{pmatrix}
  &= d_{ij} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\rho_{ij} \\ \sin\rho_{ij} \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*}</latex>
as desired.
